- Wizard notifies game server we're starting the game upon finish. Bugfix in
  KMonop::slotStartNewGame which checks whether wizard still exists before
  trying to hide it.
- Portfolio overviews are built upon game start, requires monopd which sends
  final attribute along with playerlist.
- Framework for token class.

----------

- Various code cleanups, keeping things neat.
- Playerlist and gamelist are automatically sent by server, manual request
  no longer required.

- Playerlist is fetched from server.
- Playerlist is interpreted and updated when someone enters.
- Option to finish setup and launch game, closes all wizards.
- Network object moved to KMonop, where it belongs. Wizard and its pages use
  pointers.

  list of available games to join fetched, using Qt's XML parsing
  capabilities.
