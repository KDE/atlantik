This is a very basic TODO, only aimed at the most urgent goals and
requirements. A complete reference would be the existing functionality of
monopd.

v create base class, AtlanticDaemon
  v add monopigator method and timer
  v create serversocket here
  - let serversocket signal and atlanticd create client object
  - create game object
  - send list of games upon new connect
