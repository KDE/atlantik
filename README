KMonop is a KDE client for playing the Monopoly boardgame using a monopd
server. KMonop is very alpha: it polished nor functional. The same actually
also applies for the server and the network code the server relies on.

KMonop is currently only available from KDE CVS.
monopd can be downloaded from http://capsi.com/~cap/monopd/
