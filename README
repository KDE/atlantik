KMonop is a KDE client for playing the Monopoly boardgame using a monopd
server. The program is very alpha at the moment: it is polished nor
functional. The same actually applies for the server and the network code
the server relies on.

KMonop is currently only available from KDE CVS, in the kdenonbeta module.
monopd can be downloaded from http://capsi.com/~cap/monopd/

There is a mailinglist available for discussion of kmonop development:

To subscribe, send e-mail to: kmonop-devel-subscribe@lists.capsi.com
To post, send e-mail to: kmonop-devel@lists.capsi.com

At the moment this list also covers the development of the monopd server.

The TODO file gives a nice approximation of desired functionality and
priorities. It can be used as roadmap or checklist. Please note that version
numbers have little meaning at the moment, this will change as soon as the
game is somewhat playable and non-CVS releases are useful.
