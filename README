1. Introduction
---------------

KMonop is a KDE client for playing the Monopoly boardgame using a monopd
server.

2. Download
-----------

KMonop can be downloaded from

http://capsi.com/kmonop/

and monopd can be downloaded from

http://capsi.com/~cap/monopd/

However, the latest versions of both projects are found in CVS.

KMonop is located in the CVS repository of the KDE project in the module
kdenonbeta. See

http://www.kde.org/anoncvs.html

for instructions how to download KDE modules from CVS.

For more information on monopd CVS see the monopd pages on

http://sourceforge.net/projects/monopd/

Both monopd and KMonop are in heavy development and it is important to match
versions when connecting to a game server. Two dedicated servers are
available on monopd.capsi.com, one running the latest released version of
monopd and one running the latest CVS version.

3. Mailinglist
--------------

There is a mailinglist available for discussion of KMonop development:

There is a seperate mailinglist for monopd related discussion:

4. Roadmap
----------

The TODO file gives a nice approximation of desired functionality and
priorities. It can be used as roadmap or checklist.

5. Copyrights and patents
-------------------------

Many people have expressed their concerns about possible copyrights and
patents applicable to Monopoly games and the possible implications for
KMonop development.

All possible coyrighted artwork in KMonop has been replaced by original
artwork. Parker Brothers has no rights to this folk game other than their
visual enhancements, as confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Furthermore, KMonop has little or no code which is aware of the game rules,
streetnames or board layout. These aspects of the game are all collected in
the monopd daemon and are only visualized by KMonop during gameplay - much
like a webbrowser visualizes Internet content.
