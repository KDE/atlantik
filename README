1. Introduction
---------------

KMonop is a KDE client for playing the Monopoly boardgame using a monopd
server. The program is very alpha at the moment: it is polished nor
functional. The same actually applies for the server and the network code
the server relies on.

2. Download
-----------

KMonop can be downloaded from http://capsi.com/kmonop/
monopd snapshots can be downloaded from http://capsi.com/~cap/monopd/ but

The latest versions however can be found in CVS. KMonop is located in the
CVS repository of the KDE project in the module kdenonbeta. For more
information on monopd CVS see http://sourceforge.net/projects/monopd/

You must *always* use the latest version of monopd that is available: most
of the messages between client and server are still being rewritten in a not
backwards compatible way. Furthermore, KMonop is only the client and depends
on the server very much: when the ability to show a playerlist is added to
KMonop, the ability to generate it must be added to the server!

3. Mailinglist
--------------

There is a mailinglist available for discussion of kmonop development:

To subscribe, send e-mail to: kmonop-devel-subscribe@lists.capsi.com
To post, send e-mail to: kmonop-devel@lists.capsi.com

At the moment this list also covers the development of the monopd server.

4. Roadmap
----------

The TODO file gives a nice approximation of desired functionality and
priorities. It can be used as roadmap or checklist.

Please note that version numbers have little meaning at the moment, this
will change as soon as the game is somewhat playable and non-CVS releases
are useful.
