1. Introduction
---------------

KMonop is a KDE client for playing the Monopoly boardgame using a monopd
server.

2. Download
-----------

KMonop can be downloaded from

http://capsi.com/kmonop/

and monopd can be downloaded from

http://capsi.com/~cap/monopd/

However, the latest versions of both projects are found in CVS.

KMonop is located in the CVS repository of the KDE project in the module
kdenonbeta. See

http://www.kde.org/anoncvs.html

for instructions how to download KDE modules from CVS.

For more information on monopd CVS see the monopd pages on

http://sourceforge.net/projects/monopd/

Both monopd and KMonop are in heavy development and it is important to match
versions when connecting to a game server. Two dedicated servers are
available on monopd.capsi.com, one running the latest released version of
monopd and one running the latest CVS version.

3. Mailinglist
--------------

There is a mailinglist available for discussion of KMonop development:

There is a seperate mailinglist for monopd related discussion:

4. Roadmap
----------

The TODO file gives a nice approximation of desired functionality and
priorities. It can be used as roadmap or checklist.

5. Copyrights, trademarks and patents
-------------------------------------

Many people have expressed their concerns about possible copyrights and
patents applicable to Monopoly games and the possible implications for
KMonop development.

For example, on kde-core-devel:

But how aggresively exactly?
 
* KMonop has been in existance since June 1998. It was inpsired by `monopd'',
a game in the bsdgames package which has been part of my Slackware since at
least 1995 - the manual page on monopd has March 25, 1993 as date.
 
A quick search on "Monopoly boardgame" on Google returns KMonop as #1 result
and as #6 result on Altavista. As well as a multitude of other computer
versions of real estate trading games more or less similar to Monopoly®.

Apparently Parker Brothers has not attempted (or failed) to defend their
trademark for almost a decade!

* KMonop will ship with original artwork, designed to not resemble the
Parker Brother's look and feel - KMonop implements a folk game.

Parker Brothers has no rights to this folk game other than their copyrighted
visual enhancements, as confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.

* KMonop has little or no code which is aware of the game rules, street
names, board layout or any other aspect of the game. It only visualizes
these aspects during gameplay - much like a webbrowser visualizes Internet
content.

All game logic itself is embedded in monopd, which in turn will ship with
the customized rules that have been played by families for decades as
defaults and not with the same rulset as the Parker Brothers game.
