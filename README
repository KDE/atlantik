KMonop is a KDE client for playing the Monopoly boardgame using a monopd
server. The program is very alpha at the moment: it is polished nor
functional. The same actually applies for the server and the network code
the server relies on.

KMonop is currently only available from KDE CVS, in the kdenonbeta module.
monopd can be downloaded from http://capsi.com/~cap/monopd/

Please note that at the moment it is not yet possible to play games! All you
can do is load the program and think "that's a nice interface" and exit.

There is a mailinglist available for discussion of kmonop development:

Subscribe: kmonop-devel-subscribe@lists.capsi.com
Post: kmonop-devel@lists.capsi.com

At the moment this list also covers the development of the server.
