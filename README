1. Introduction
---------------

Atlantik is a KDE client for playing Monopoly-like games on the monopd
network.

Purpose of the Atlantic board game is to acquire land in major cities in
North America and Europe while being a transatlantic traveller. One of the
game modes plays like the popular real estate board game based on Atlantic
City street names.

Atlantik was previously known as KMonop and might still be refered to as
such in some documentation.

2. Download
-----------

Atlantik can be downloaded from

http://unixcode.org/atlantik/

and monopd can be downloaded from

http://unixcode.org/monopd/

However, the latest versions of both projects are found in CVS.

Atlantik is located in the CVS repository of the KDE project in the module
kdegames. See http://www.kde.org/anoncvs.html for instructions how to
download KDE modules from CVS. Atlantik is included in the kdegames package
since the KDE 3.1 release.

For more information on monopd CVS see the monopd pages on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/monopd/

Both monopd and Atlantik are in heavy development and it is important to match
versions when connecting to a game server. One can choose a suitable server
through the Monopigator interface.

3. Mailinglists
--------------=

There are mailinglists available for discussion of Atlantik development. The
atlantik-devel list is for general discussion and development of the
codebase, the atlantik-cvs list has all the CVS commits in it and the
atlantik-artists list is for the development of GFX/SFX for Atlantik.

See http://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/atlantik-devel
See http://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/atlantik-cvs
and http://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/atlantik-artists

on information on subscribing, posting and list archives.

There is a seperate mailinglist for monopd related discussion:

To subscribe, send e-mail to: monopd-devel-subscribe@lists.capsi.com
To post, send e-mail to: monopd-devel@lists.capsi.com

4. Roadmap
----------

The TODO file gives a nice approximation of desired functionality and
priorities. It can be used as roadmap or checklist.

5. Designer
-----------

Atlantik Designer is a game board designer that will create game config
files for monopd. You can find it in KDE CVS, module kdeaddons.

6. Copyrights, trademarks and patents
-------------------------------------

Many people have expressed their concerns about possible copyrights and
patents applicable to Monopoly games and the possible implications for
Atlantik development and distribution.

In our defense:

* Atlantik is NOT Monopoly! It's a completely different boardgame! It does
however ship with a game which has a closer resemblance to Monopoly and
features the streets of Atlantic City, based on the folk game upon which
Parker Brothers based their game. This clone will ship with original
artwork, designed to not resemble the Parker Brothers' look and feel.

Parker Brothers has no rights to this folk game other than their copyrighted
visual enhancements, as confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
<http://www.antimonopoly.com/graphics/evolution.gif>

* Atlantik has little or no code which is aware of the game rules, street
names, board layout or any other aspect of the game. It only visualizes
these aspects during gameplay - much like a web browser visualizes Internet
content.

All game logic itself is embedded in monopd, which in turn will ship with
the customized rules that have been played by families for decades as
defaults and not with the same ruleset as the Parker Brothers game.
