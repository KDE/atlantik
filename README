1. Introduction
---------------

KMonop is a KDE client for playing the Monopoly boardgame using a monopd
server. The program is very alpha at the moment: it is polished nor
functional. The same actually applies for the server and the network code
the server relies on.

2. Download
-----------

KMonop is currently only available from KDE CVS, in the kdenonbeta module.
monopd can be downloaded from http://capsi.com/~cap/monopd/

You must *always* use the latest snapshot of monopd that is available.

Most of the messages between client and server are still being rewritten in
a not backwards compatible way. Furthermore, KMonop is only the client and
depends on the server very much: when the ability to show a playerlist is
added to KMonop, the ability to generate it must be added to the server!

I will try and update the monopd server code snapshot every time I make a
major commit of KMonop client code, to make sure you can practically always
run the same code as I do.

3. Mailinglist
--------------

There is a mailinglist available for discussion of kmonop development:

To subscribe, send e-mail to: kmonop-devel-subscribe@lists.capsi.com
To post, send e-mail to: kmonop-devel@lists.capsi.com

At the moment this list also covers the development of the monopd server.

4. Roadmap
----------

The TODO file gives a nice approximation of desired functionality and
priorities. It can be used as roadmap or checklist.

Please note that version numbers have little meaning at the moment, this
will change as soon as the game is somewhat playable and non-CVS releases
are useful.
