1. Introduction
---------------

Atlantik is a KDE client for playing Monopoly-like games on the monopd
network.

Purpose of the Atlantic board game is to acquire land in major cities in
North America and Europe while being a transatlantic traveller. One of the
game modes plays like the popular real estate board game based on Atlantic
City street names.

Atlantik was previously known as KMonop and might still be referred to as
such in some documentation.

2. Download
-----------

Atlantik can be downloaded from

http://unixcode.org/atlantik/

and monopd can be downloaded from

http://unixcode.org/monopd/

However, the latest versions of both projects are found in CVS.

Atlantik is located in the CVS repository of the KDE project in the module
kdegames. See http://www.kde.org/anoncvs.html for instructions how to
download KDE modules from CVS. Atlantik is included in the kdegames package
since the KDE 3.1 release.

For more information on monopd CVS see the monopd pages on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/monopd/

Both monopd and Atlantik are in heavy development and it is important to match
versions when connecting to a game server. One can choose a suitable server
through the Monopigator interface.

3. Mailinglists
--------------=

There are mailinglists available for discussion of Atlantik development. The
atlantik-devel list is for general discussion and development of the
codebase, the atlantik-cvs list has all the CVS commits in it and the
atlantik-artists list is for the development of GFX/SFX for Atlantik.

See http://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/atlantik-devel
See http://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/atlantik-cvs
and http://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/atlantik-artists

on information on subscribing, posting and list archives.

There is a seperate mailinglist for monopd related discussion:

To subscribe, send e-mail to: monopd-devel-subscribe@lists.capsi.com
To post, send e-mail to: monopd-devel@lists.capsi.com

4. Roadmap
----------

The TODO file gives a nice approximation of desired functionality and
priorities. It can be used as roadmap or checklist.

5. Designer
-----------

Atlantik Designer is a game board designer that will create game config
files for monopd. You can find it in KDE CVS, module kdeaddons.

6. Legal issues
---------------

Many people have expressed their concerns about possible copyrights,
trademarks and patents applicable to Monopoly® and the possible implications
for Atlantik (and monopd) development and distribution.

I believe that Atlantik and monopd are completely clear of violating any
copyrights, trademarks or patents and that there are no legal issues that
might affect development or distibution of either application.
