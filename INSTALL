Assuming you downloaded kdenonbeta from CVS:

(cd ../kdenonbeta && make -f Makefile.cvs && ./configure)
cd kmonop && make && make install

Then click on K->Games->Board->KMonop or run kmonop. Please note that KMonop
is only a client, you will also need the monopd server running! See the
README file for more details.
