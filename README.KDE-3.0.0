Atlantik uses KExtendedSocket to connect to monopd servers. Due to a bug in
KBufferedIO in kdelibs-3.0.0, you might experience unexplained crashes when
using Atlantik with KDE 3.0.0 release.

It is recommended to run Atlantik with at least KDE 3.0.1 or a KDE CVS
checkout of the HEAD branch recent enough to contain revision 1.6 of
kdelibs/kdecore/kbufferedio.cpp (Tue Apr 30 13:26:14 2002).
