^ in progress
? fixed but unconfirmed
v implemented

monopd API changes
-------------------

- playerupdate's jailcard stuff is now outofjailcards=<int>

Bugfixes
--------

- player name change doesn't make it to trade money items
- Update messages views after resize.
- Token should not have to know about EstateView, views could be independent
? roll button not enabled after using jail card?
- find a good starting location for tokens

For 0.3.1
---------

- define minimum size for AtlantikBoard and center widget
- re-order comboboxes in trade widget
- kapp should own gui(kmainwindow), network and core and connect them
v move all but mainwindow to libatlantikui
  (ui -> core -> net -> core -> ui)
- is it necessary to keep AtlantikConfig at all? animateToken could be used in Board only, for example
- Option to configure toolbars (at least be able to save size/text settings)
v More descriptive window titles
v money updates from network don't make it to a gui update
v request playerlist after joining game
v update token geometry when player's jail status changed
v clicking estate on portfolio should update central widget
