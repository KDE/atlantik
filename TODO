Please put your uncategorized wishlist items for monopd/KMonop here and I
will add them to the respective TODO's. Leave your name and e-mail if you
desire.

<Neil> try scaling those icons along with the board, Workzilla
<Neil> as-is they're way too small when maximized on 1152x864

<malte> Capzilla|atwork: and maybe a visualization of whom something belongs to on the map or at least if it's yours

- Update messages views after resize.

  too small.

- Port new game wizard away from KWizard again, our network validation code
  makes using a pre-defined wizard a difficult task, it's easier to create
  our own widget.
- Do a thorough check on pointers and memory leaks.
- Fix token movement bugs:
  - does jumpToken (activated by monop timeout) cancel animation?
  - animation speed should depend on board size and movement distance
  V disable roll/buy toolbar buttons depending on game status
    - at the moment based on turn, must be more precise
      - monopd requires diffed command availability

For 0.3.x
---------

- Game configuration (when it appears in monopd)
v Use i18n()
- Fetch serverlist via Monopigator kind of interface.
- Have a playable, more or less stable game.
- Code documentation
  - board.h
  - colordefs.h
  - config.h
  - configdlg.h
  - estateview.h
  V kmonop.h
  - main.h
  - network.h
  - newgamedlg.h
  - portfolioestate.h
  - portfolioview.h
  - token.h

For 0.9.x
---------

- Beta series.
- Move to kdegames during 2.3 development and prepare for 1.0.0 release for
  2.3 final.

For 1.0.0
---------

- Have a game suitable for inclusion in kdegames. Nice icons, stable code,
  etcetera.
- Version 1.0.0 should be released with KDE 2.3, so after the last 2.3 beta
  KMonop version will be moved from 0.9.x to 1.0.0.

For 1.x.y
---------

- See mailinglist. It is unlikely that themes (Star Wars, etc) will be
  supported for 1.0, but other more advanced options such as game
  configuration etcetera should be present. These items are not a
  requirement for inclusion in kdegames, but the 1.0 release should be
  up-to-par with the original Windows version of the game.
