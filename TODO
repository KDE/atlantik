  - code to load/scale appropriate icon
  - whats better? SmallIcon(...) or BarIcon(..., 16) ??
- Do a thorough check on pointers and memory leaks.
- Fix token movement bugs:
  - does jumpToken (activated by monopd timeout) cancel animation?
  - animation speed should depend on board size and movement distance
  V disable roll/buy toolbar buttons depending on game status
    - at the moment based on turn, must be more precise
      - monopd requires diffed command availability

For 0.3.x
---------

- More descriptive window titles
- Game configuration (when it appears in monopd)
v Use i18n()
- Have a playable, more or less stable game.
- Code documentation
  - board.h
  - colordefs.h
  - config.h
  - configdlg.h

For 0.9.x
---------

- Beta series.
- Move to kdegames during 3.1 alpha's and prepare for 1.0.0 release for
  3.1 final.

For 1.0.0
---------

- Have a game suitable for inclusion in kdegames. Nice icons, stable code,
  etcetera.
- Version 1.0.0 should be released with KDE 3.1, so after the last
  beta Atlantik version will be moved from 0.9.x to 1.0.0.

For 1.x.y
---------

- See mailinglist. It is unlikely that themes (Star Trek/Wars, Kiki Dunst,
  Simpsons, etc) will be supported for 1.0, but other more advanced options
  such as game configuration etcetera should be present. These items are not
  a requirement for inclusion in kdegames, but the 1.0 release should be
  up-to-par with the original Windows version of the game.n
