For 0.0.2
---------

- Finish newgamedlg wizard:
  v Serverlist needn't be real yet, no way to fetch it at the moment.
  v Gamelist needs to be real and present an option to create a new game.
  - Report error in case connection cannot be made.
  - Game configuration needn't be implemented yet, missing functionality in
    monopd server.
  v Game playerlist must be displayed and present an option to launch the
    game. (display works, although server code doesn't not yet inform
    regarding people leaving)
  v Upon startgame, use playerupdate to init/update portfolios. Final
    playerlist is already deprecated then. ;-)

For 0.0.3
---------

- Fetch (default) game data from server (streetnames).
v Don't overwrite estate pointer in board.cpp, actually have a nice array.
v Portfolioview states should represent actual situation.
v Draw tokens on board at actual position.
- Allow rolling the dice and advancing over board (without actions).
- Move most of the dom parsing back to network.cpp and emit more specialized
  signals such as moveToken(id, pos);


For 0.1.x
---------

- Make things work. ;-)
- Do a thorough check on pointers and memory leaks.

For 0.2.x
---------

- Use i18n() for all messages. Until 0.2.x this is not recommendable because
  too many strings will yet change and it would be a waste of time to
  translate those strings. Once the game is working more or less, messages
  are likely to freeze and translations are more than welcome. Note: strings
  such as streetnames are not to be translated! It should be perfectly
  normal to play a game in German with original US streetnames such as
  Boardwalk.

For 0.5.x
---------

- Fetch serverlist via Monopigator kind of interface.
- Have a playable, more or less stable game.

For 0.6.x
---------

- Have a game suitable for inclusion in kdegames. Nice icons, stable code,
  etcetera.

For 1.0.0
---------

- See mailinglist. It is unlikely that themes (Star Wars, etc) will be
  supported for 1.0, but other more advanced options such as game
  configuration etcetera should be present. These items are not a
  requirement for inclusion in kdegames, but the 1.0 release should be
  up-to-par with the original Windows version of the game.
