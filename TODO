Bugfixes
--------

- Update messages views after resize.
- store <updateplayerlist> data, we cannot guarantee that <joinedgame/>
  (which creates the listview connected to the related signals) is sent prior
  to any of those updates
- estates should check whether they need to init tokens upon estate init
- Token should not have to know about EstateView, views could be independent
- KExtendedSocket errorcodes/port
- connect Player::changed() to trade widget (for list items)
- connect Player::changed() to auction widget (for list items)
- bugs from Neil's trial report
  - Trade dialog functionless, but you knew that
  - Deed icons shown on non-deeded squares (jail, free parking, go to jail)
  - Can't tell who owns which railroads and utilities, as the upper left only shows streets
  - No notification of when someone got sent to jail
  - Should display in console chance/community chest cards (reenable that optionally?)
  - Kagato (income tax) doesn't charge me.. it's set to 10% or $200 (monopd)
  ? Hm, my turn came, I used get out of jail free, said I could roll, but only X was active (monopd)
  - Trying to get out of jail before turn starts gives ERR (monopd / disable icons)

- kapp should own gui(kmainwindow), network and core and connect them
- move all but mainwindow to libatlantikui
  (ui -> core -> net -> core -> ui)
- different modes for *views: Play and Edit, for example EstateView should
  have a RMB canBeOwned option in Edit mode, but not in Play mode.

  - code to load/scale appropriate icon
  - whats better? SmallIcon(...) or BarIcon(..., 16) ??
- Do a thorough check on pointers and memory leaks.
- Fix token movement bugs:
  - does jumpToken (activated by monopd timeout) cancel animation?
  - animation speed should depend on board size and movement distance
  v disable roll/buy toolbar buttons depending on game status
    - at the moment based on turn, must be more precise
      - monopd requires diffed command availability

For 0.4.x
---------

- More descriptive window titles
- Game configuration (when it appears in monopd)
v Use i18n()
- Have a playable, more or less stable game.
- Code documentation
  - board.h
  - colordefs.h
  - config.h
  - configdlg.h
  - estateview.h
  - atlantik.h
  - main.h
  - network.h
  - selectconfiguration_widget.h
  - selectgame_widget.h
  - selectserver_widget.h
  - portfolioestate.h
  - portfolioview.h
  - token.h
- Visualization of owners on board itself

For 0.9.x
---------

- Beta series.
- Move to kdegames during 3.1 alpha's and prepare for 1.0.0 release for
  3.1 final.

For 1.0.0
---------

- Have a game suitable for inclusion in kdegames. Nice icons, stable code,
  etcetera.
- Version 1.0.0 should be released with KDE 3.1, so after the last
  beta Atlantik version will be moved from 0.9.x to 1.0.0.

For 1.x.y
---------

- See mailinglist. It is unlikely that themes (Star Trek/Wars, Kiki Dunst,
  Simpsons, etc) will be supported for 1.0, but other more advanced options
  such as game configuration etcetera should be present. These items are not
  a requirement for inclusion in kdegames, but the 1.0 release should be
  up-to-par with the original Windows version of the game.
