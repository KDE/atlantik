Wishlist
--------

Please put your uncategorized wishlist items for monopd/KMonop here and I
will add them to the respective TODO's. Leave your name and e-mail if you
desire.

<jasonkb> titlebar now: "Monopoly for KDE - KMonop" is kinda redundant and useless.. perhaps "JasonKB - KMonop" ..? 

<this space left blank intentionally>

  - code to load/scale appropriate icon

- Fix token movement bugs:
  - does jumpToken (activated by monop timeout) cancel animation?
  - animation speed should depend on board size and movement distance
  V disable roll/buy toolbar buttons depending on game status
    - at the moment based on turn, must be more precise
      - monopd requires diffed command availability

For 0.3.x
---------

- Port new game wizard away from KWizard again, our network validation code
  makes using a pre-defined wizard a difficult task, it's easier to create
  our own widget.
- Game configuration (when it appears in monopd)
v Use i18n()
- Have a playable, more or less stable game.
- Code documentation
  - board.h
  - colordefs.h
  - config.h
  - configdlg.h
  - estateview.h
  V kmonop.h
  - main.h
  - network.h
  - newgamedlg.h
  - portfolioestate.h
  - portfolioview.h
  - token.h
- Visualization of owners on board itself

For 0.9.x
---------

- Beta series.
- Move to kdegames during 2.3 development and prepare for 1.0.0 release for
  2.3 final.

For 1.0.0
---------

- Have a game suitable for inclusion in kdegames. Nice icons, stable code,
  etcetera.
- Version 1.0.0 should be released with KDE 2.3, so after the last 2.3 beta
  KMonop version will be moved from 0.9.x to 1.0.0.

For 1.x.y
---------

- See mailinglist. It is unlikely that themes (Star Wars, etc) will be
  supported for 1.0, but other more advanced options such as game
  configuration etcetera should be present. These items are not a
  requirement for inclusion in kdegames, but the 1.0 release should be
  up-to-par with the original Windows version of the game.
