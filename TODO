<this space left blank intentionally>

For 0.2.x
---------

- Support .gd game description.
- Support leaving jail.
- Icons on gameboard.
  V Station
  - Utility
  V CC
  V Chance
  - Go
  - FP
  - Jail
  - toJail
  - Tax
  V Luxury Tax
- Game configuration (when it appears in monopd)
- Port new game wizard away from KWizard again, our network validation code
  makes using a pre-defined wizard a difficult task, it's easier to create
  our own widget.
- Do a thorough check on pointers and memory leaks.
- Fix token movement bugs:
  - monopd allows new commands before we're done moving, we require a "done"
    command and "timeout" message (in case a client is not "done" soon enough,
    monopd should be able to issue a "well then stop playing and just set the
    board as it should be)
  - animation speed should depend on board size and movement distance
  V disable roll/buy toolbar buttons depending on game status
    - at the moment based on turn, must be more precise

For 0.3.x
---------

- Use i18n() for all messages. Until 0.2.x this is not recommendable because
  too many strings will yet change and it would be a waste of time to
  translate those strings. Once the game is working more or less, messages
  are likely to freeze and translations are more than welcome. Note: strings
  such as streetnames are not to be translated! It should be perfectly
  normal to play a game in German with original US streetnames such as
  Boardwalk.
- Fetch serverlist via Monopigator kind of interface.
- Have a playable, more or less stable game.

For 1.0.0
---------

- Have a game suitable for inclusion in kdegames. Nice icons, stable code,
  etcetera.

For 1.x.y
---------

- See mailinglist. It is unlikely that themes (Star Wars, etc) will be
  supported for 1.0, but other more advanced options such as game
  configuration etcetera should be present. These items are not a
  requirement for inclusion in kdegames, but the 1.0 release should be
  up-to-par with the original Windows version of the game.
