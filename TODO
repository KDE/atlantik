- not implemented
^ in progress
? fixed but unconfirmed
v implemented

monopd API changes
-------------------

- playerupdate's jailcard stuff is now outofjailcards=<int>

Bugfixes
--------

- money updates from network don't make it to a gui update
- Update messages views after resize.
- store <updateplayerlist> data, we cannot guarantee that <joinedgame/>
  (which creates the listview connected to the related signals) is sent prior
  to any of those updates
- estates should check whether they need to init tokens upon estate init
- Token should not have to know about EstateView, views could be independent
- bugs from Neil's trial report
  - Should display in console chance/community chest cards (reenable that optionally?)
  ? Hm, my turn came, I used get out of jail free, said I could roll, but only X was active (monopd)
  - Trying to get out of jail before turn starts gives ERR (monopd)
- clicking estate on portfolio should update central widget
- when a token is hidden because it has no associated estate, store a reminder to show it when
  a suitable estate is initialised (iterate player, player->estateView == 0 && estateId ==
  player->location)
- update token geometry when player's jail status changed

For 0.3.0
---------

v support for <display>
  v 10/200% tax
    v remove widget after paying (monopd needs to send a display reset)
v Different token placement when in jail
v fix portfolio
  v non street estates in portfolio (depends on proper monopd groups)
  v do some relayouting based on the estategroup order
v decent copyright and license notice in code and headers
v add usercount support within monopigator

For 0.3.1
---------

- define minimum size for AtlantikBoard and center widget
- re-order comboboxes in trade widget
- kapp should own gui(kmainwindow), network and core and connect them
v move all but mainwindow to libatlantikui
  (ui -> core -> net -> core -> ui)
- is it necessary to keep AtlantikConfig at all? animateToken could be used in Board only, for example
- Option to configure toolbars (at least be able to save size/text settings)
- More descriptive window titles

For 0.4.0
---------

- fancy widgets
  - generic (caption and description)
  ^ estate

  - code to load/scale appropriate icon
  - whats better? SmallIcon(...) or BarIcon(..., 16) ??
- Fix token movement bugs:
  - does jumpToken (activated by monopd timeout) cancel animation?
  - animation speed should depend on board size and movement distance
  v disable roll/buy toolbar buttons depending on game status
