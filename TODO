- not implemented
^ in progress
? fixed but unconfirmed
v implemented

monopd API change
------------------

- playerupdate's jailcard stuff is now outofjailcards=<int>
- Estate::m_group should be EstateGroup *, not QString

Bugfixes
--------

- Update messages views after resize.
- store <updateplayerlist> data, we cannot guarantee that <joinedgame/>
  (which creates the listview connected to the related signals) is sent prior
  to any of those updates
- estates should check whether they need to init tokens upon estate init
- Token should not have to know about EstateView, views could be independent
v KExtendedSocket errorcodes/port
- bugs from Neil's trial report
  - No notification of when someone got sent to jail
  - Should display in console chance/community chest cards (reenable that optionally?)
  - Kagato (income tax) doesn't charge me.. it's set to 10% or $200 (monopd)
  ? Hm, my turn came, I used get out of jail free, said I could roll, but only X was active (monopd)
  - Trying to get out of jail before turn starts gives ERR (monopd)
- clicking estate on portfolio should update central widget
- tradeitems in widget are still not changed when player name changes
- when a token is hidden because it has no associated estate, store a reminder to show it when
  a suitable estate is initialised (iterate player, player->estateView == 0 && estateId ==
  player->location)
- update token geometry when player's jail status changed

For 0.3.0
---------

- gameNetwork API
  - commands
    - .D
v support for <display>
  - commandlist plugin for display_widget
    - class skeleton
    - buttons for each command
    - availability influences buttons
    - buttons connect to network API
  - fancy widgets
    - generic (name (title) and description)
    v estate
    - dice
    - leaving jail
    - 10/200% tax
v Different token placement when in jail
v fix portfolio
  v non street estates in portfolio (depends on proper monopd groups)
  - Chance/CC cards in portfolio
  v do some relayouting based on the estategroup order

For 0.3.1
---------

- define minimum size for AtlantikBoard and center widget
- re-order comboboxes in trade widget
- kapp should own gui(kmainwindow), network and core and connect them
v move all but mainwindow to libatlantikui
  (ui -> core -> net -> core -> ui)
- turn AtlantikConfig into real class instead of struct
- is it necessary to keep AtlantikConfig at all? animateToken could be used in Board only, for example

  - code to load/scale appropriate icon
  - whats better? SmallIcon(...) or BarIcon(..., 16) ??
- Do a thorough check on pointers and memory leaks.
- Fix token movement bugs:
  - does jumpToken (activated by monopd timeout) cancel animation?
  - animation speed should depend on board size and movement distance
  v disable roll/buy toolbar buttons depending on game status
    - at the moment based on turn, must be more precise
      - monopd requires diffed command availability
