- not implemented
^ in progress
v implemented

Bugfixes
--------

- Update messages views after resize.
- store <updateplayerlist> data, we cannot guarantee that <joinedgame/>
  (which creates the listview connected to the related signals) is sent prior
  to any of those updates
- estates should check whether they need to init tokens upon estate init
- rename PortfolioEstate to TinyEstateView
- Token should not have to know about EstateView, views could be independent

For 0.2.0
---------

- seperate engine from network (network uses engine, not other way around,
  engine could also be used without network in atlanticdesigner)
  - move network layer to libatlantiknetwork
  - kmainwindow should own network and core and connect them
    - later: kapp should own gui(kmainwindow), network and core and connect them
- move all but mainwindow to libatlantikui
  Atlantik then uses atlantikui, which talks to atlantikcore, which uses
  atlantic
- complete trades
 v network api
 ^ trade object
 ^ widget
- different modes for *views: Play and Edit, for example EstateView should
  have a RMB canBeOwned option in Edit mode, but not in Play mode.

For 0.2.1
---------

- remove config global var
v support for <display>
  v type chancecard (attrs playerid, name and description)

  - code to load/scale appropriate icon
  - whats better? SmallIcon(...) or BarIcon(..., 16) ??
- Do a thorough check on pointers and memory leaks.
- Fix token movement bugs:
  - does jumpToken (activated by monopd timeout) cancel animation?
  - animation speed should depend on board size and movement distance
  V disable roll/buy toolbar buttons depending on game status
    - at the moment based on turn, must be more precise
      - monopd requires diffed command availability

For 0.4.x
---------

- More descriptive window titles
- Game configuration (when it appears in monopd)
v Use i18n()
- Have a playable, more or less stable game.
- Code documentation
  - board.h
  - colordefs.h
  - config.h
  - configdlg.h
  - estateview.h
  - atlantik.h
  - main.h
  - network.h
  - selectconfiguration_widget.h

For 0.9.x
---------

- Beta series.
- Move to kdegames during 3.1 alpha's and prepare for 1.0.0 release for
  3.1 final.

For 1.0.0
---------

- Have a game suitable for inclusion in kdegames. Nice icons, stable code,
  etcetera.
- Version 1.0.0 should be released with KDE 3.1, so after the last
  beta Atlantik version will be moved from 0.9.x to 1.0.0.

For 1.x.y
---------

- See mailinglist. It is unlikely that themes (Star Trek/Wars, Kiki Dunst,
  Simpsons, etc) will be supported for 1.0, but other more advanced options
  such as game configuration etcetera should be present. These items are not
  a requirement for inclusion in kdegames, but the 1.0 release should be
  up-to-par with the original Windows version of the game.n
