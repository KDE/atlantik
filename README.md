## Introduction

Atlantik is a KDE client for playing Monopoly-like games on the monopd
network.

Purpose of the Atlantic board game is to acquire land in major cities in
North America and Europe while being a transatlantic traveller. One of the
game modes plays like the popular real estate board game based on Atlantic
City street names.

Atlantik was previously known as KMonop and might still be referred to as
such in some documentation.

## Download

Atlantik can be downloaded from:
https://apps.kde.org/atlantik/

Atlantik is developed in the KDE invent games group in the module
https://invent.kde.org/games/atlantik.

A game server monopd is available at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/monopd/


## Mailinglists

There are mailinglists available for discussion of Atlantik development. The
kde-games-devel list is for general discussion and development of the
codebase.

See https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-games-devel

for information on subscribing, posting and list archives.

## Roadmap

The TODO file gives a nice approximation of desired functionality and
priorities. It can be used as roadmap or checklist.

## Legal issues

Many people have expressed their concerns about possible copyrights,
trademarks and patents applicable to Monopoly® and the possible implications
for Atlantik (and monopd) development and distribution.

I believe that Atlantik and monopd are completely clear of violating any
copyrights, trademarks or patents and that there are no legal issues that
might affect development or distibution of either application.

### The Game Itself

Although Atlantik is not yet as generic as I envision it,
you will find no code in Atlantik at all which even remotely
refers to Monopoly® game rules, definitions or object names and looks.
Atlantik only visualizes these aspects during gameplay, much like a web
browser visualizes Internet content. Any artwork used is original and has
been specifically designed not to closely resemble the artwork of Parker
Brothers.

Monopd implements two games currently. One of them indeed has a close
resemblence to Monopoly® and features the streets of Atlantic City just
like Monopoly®. However, this is a folk game predating Parker Brothers
Monopoly®. Parker Brothers has no rights to this folk game other than
their copyrighted visual enhancements.

The Monopoly® Trademark

Atlantik was renamed from KMonop to avoid possible legal action over
the Monopoly® trademark. Wherever the phrase Monopoly® is used, it
should be accompanied with the registered trademark symbol, except
there where I use "Monopoly-like" which is my preferred term as
monopd boards can be completely customized and changed in a
configuration file.
