Some of the things that might not make sense when you examin the code for
the first time:

- the new game wizard is no longer a dialog, but for historic reasons it is
  still in the files newgamedlg.[cpp|h]
- The Atlantik class initially manages widgets and objects.
- Objects such as Player manage the content of their own views (such as
  portfolioview) once they are created (Atlantik should create object and
  their respective widgets simultaneously).
- GameNetwork interacts with the server daemon. It has several public
  methods which can be used to send data to the server and it sends several
  signals. Atlantik's slots listen for player/object management related
  signals and objects themselves listen for content/data related signals.
