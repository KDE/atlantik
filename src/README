Some of the things that might not make sense when you examin the code for
the first time:

- the new game wizard is no longer a dialog, but for historic reasons it is
  still in the files newgamedlg.[cpp|h]

- there are no entities such as player. KMonop was not designed to actually
  play a Monopoly game! (hm, no?) No! It was designed to interact with a
  monopd server which plays the game. And it was designed to visualize that
  game.

  Future versions might include a player class for the sake of convenience,
  but at the moment the interaction with the server is - in a way - more
  straightforward: if a player joins the game, we don't create a player
  instance ourselves but we simply add a portfolioview.
