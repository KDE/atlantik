Some of the things that might not make sense when you examin the code for
the first time:

- the new game wizard is no longer a dialog, but for historic reasons it is
  still in the files newgamedlg.[cpp|h]

- there are no entities such as player. Atlantik was not designed to
  actually play a Monopoly game! (hm, no?) No! It was designed to interact
  with a monopd server which plays the game. And it was designed to
  visualize that game.

  Future versions might include a player class for the sake of convenience,
  but at the moment the interaction with the server is - in a way - more
  straightforward: if a player joins the game, we don't create a player
  instance ourselves but we simply add a portfolioview.

  (this is already backfiring on me and making trades difficult, I guess
  there will be classes such as Player soon to cache some server data. They
  will however remain generic to minimize necessary client code
  modifications in the event of changes of the server code)
