Bugfixes
--------

- fix leak of 4-300 Kb each time one switches board, i've investigated
  but haven't found leak :(
- let you delete last card in a stack, it made designer crash, so delete
  doesn't do anything if there is only 1 card on stack
- disable "Less properties" when there are no properties for a card

For 0.2.1
---------

- when libatlantikui exists, make designer a seperate app again
