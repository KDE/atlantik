- support gameboards that are not 40 estates big (in fact, atlantic will
  probably be 44 big in the end) -- it probably does already, but can't
  test because AtlantikBoard doesn't support size != 40 yet
- fix leak of 4-300 Kb each time one switches board, i've investigated
  but haven't found leak :(
- let you delete last card in a stack, it made designer crash, so delete
  doesn't do anything if there is only 1 card on stack
