- fix leak of 4-300 Kb each time one switches board, i've investigated
  but haven't found leak :(
- let you delete last card in a stack, it made designer crash, so delete
  doesn't do anything if there is only 1 card on stack
- disable "Less properties" when there are no properties for a card
- replace Estate #20 in "advanceto" pulldown with actual estate names
