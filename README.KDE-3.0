Atlantik uses KExtendedSocket to connect to monopd servers. Due to a bug in
KBufferedIO in kdelibs-3.0.0, you might experience unexplained crashes when
using Atlantik with KDE 3.0 release.

It is recommended to run Atlantik with at least KDE 3.0.1 or a CVS version
of HEAD more recent than April 30, 2002.
