Atlantik uses KExtendedSocket to connect to monopd servers. Due to some bugs
in KBufferedIO and KExtendedSocket in kdelibs, you might experience
unexplained crashes when using Atlantik with KDE 3.0, 3.0.1 or 3.0.2.

It is recommended to run Atlantik with at least KDE 3.0.3 or 3.1 Beta1, or a
KDE CVS checkout of the HEAD branch recent enough to contain revision 1.6 of
kdelibs/kdecore/kbufferedio.cpp and revision 1.39 of kextsock.cpp.
