    <p>
      Atlantik is a KDE client for playing Monopoly®-like board games on the
      monopd network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purpose of the Atlantik board game is to acquire land in major cities
      in North America and Europe while being a transatlantic traveler.
      To win the game, players improve monopolized land with profitable
      buildings in the hopes of bankrupting all other players.
    </p>
    <p>
      All game modes are served by monopd, a dedicated game server designed
      for Atlantik. One of the game modes plays like the popular real estate
      board game known as Monopoly®.
